# Hello, and this is my personal website
This is just a fun way for me to display my favorite things ultimately, but I'll be updating this fairly actively, some future additions you can expect are as follows

Future additions:
- A google document detailing my fursonas lore and backstory
- A preloading/splash screen that shows up prior to the home screen
- Smooth page transitions, similar to the likes of what Wix Studio offers (but without using that steaming pile of hot garbage)


This is just a simple site built in Astro for fun, no profits will be made from this project.
