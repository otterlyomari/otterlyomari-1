						<h4 class="t-outline" style="text-align: center;" transition:animate="fade">About me</h4>
						<p class="t-outline" style="text-align: center; color: white;" >Hi there! It's me, your friendly neighborhood otter, Omari! 
						</br> I'd like to thank you for taking the time to look at my website! </br> Now that you're here, I'd like to tell you a bit about myself</p>
						<p class="t-outline" style="text-align: center; color: white;">I'm Omari Allyn Tidemere </br> A fluffy sea otter on the internet who likes to help others and 
						</br> spread joy, if I can make as much as one person happy then 
					    </br> I'll be happy too. the smiles on others faces motivate me to keep going
					    </br> It's a reminder to me that no matter how hard things get 
					    </br> It's worth living life to the fullest.</p>
						<p class="t-outline" style="text-align: center; color: white;">I absolutely love exploring nature, telling stories, whether it's a poem, a sonnet, 
						a full-length novel, or even a video game.</p>
						<p class="t-outline" style="text-align: center; color: white;">I'm also a music producer, and you can find my works <a href="https://symphonyoftidemere.bandcamp.com/" style="color: red;" class="no-deco">here</a>.
						the tracks I make can be anything from covers, remixes, to original compositions.</p>
						<p class="t-outline" style="text-align: center; color: white;">And of course, as you may already know, I make content over on YouTube! Aimed at a diverse 
							audience of furries and non-furries alike, my content is PG-13 at best, meaning there's no profanity, nor any 
						raunchy stuff that's inappropriate for minors.</p>
						<p class="t-outline" style="text-align: center; color: white;">If you're new to my page, here's a couple of fun facts!</p>
						<p class="t-outline-w"> - Despite my online chattiness, I am incredibly shy and reserved in real life, but always welcome hugs and cuddles!!</p>
						<p class="t-outline-w"> - I am proudly pansexual and genderfluid!</p>
						<br>
						<h5 class="t-outline" style="text-align: center; color: yellow;">⚠️ Please leave my pages if you are a cyberbully! ⚠️</h5>
						<p class="t-outline-w">I dont wish to have such negativity in my life as I aim to build a positive, kind and caring community! Let's uplift one another, help each other, and never bring others down.</p>
						<p class="t-outline" style="color:white;"> Anyway, I don't want to stretch this too much longer so, have an amazing day, I love you all!

							~ Omari Allyn Tidemere</p>
